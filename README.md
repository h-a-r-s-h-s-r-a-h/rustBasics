## **Introduction**

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. This repository contains examples, explanations, and exercises for mastering the basics and beyond of Rust programming.

---

## **Topics Covered**

This repository includes code and examples for the following topics:

### **1. Common Programming Concepts**
- Fundamental types (`i32`, `f64`, `bool`, etc.)
- Functions and control flow (`if`, `match`, loops, etc.)

### **2. Ownership and Moves**
- Rustâ€™s ownership model
- Understanding moves, borrowing, and the stack vs. heap

### **3. References**
- Mutable and immutable references
- Lifetimes and their importance

### **4. Structs**
- Defining and using structs
- Tuple structs and unit-like structs

### **5. Enums and Patterns**
- Creating enums
- Pattern matching with `match` and `if let`

### **6. Error Handling**
- Using `Result` and `Option`
- Writing robust error-handling code with `unwrap`, `expect`, and `?`

### **7. Crates and Modules**
- Organizing code with modules
- Using external crates with Cargo

### **8. Traits and Generics**
- Defining and implementing traits
- Writing generic functions and structs

### **9. Iterators**
- Iterator adaptors (`map`, `filter`, `collect`)
- Custom iterators

### **10. Collections**
- Vectors, HashMaps, and Strings
- Choosing the right collection for your use case

### **11. Concurrency**
- Threads and message-passing
- Using `Mutex` and `Arc`

### **12. WebAssembly**
- Compiling Rust to WebAssembly
- Interfacing with JavaScript

## **Why Rust?**

Rust is known for its:
- **Safety**: Memory safety without a garbage collector.
- **Performance**: As fast as C/C++, with modern abstractions.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in features to prevent data races.

By learning Rust, you're preparing yourself to build robust and efficient systems.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) using `rustup`.

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
cd rust-basics
